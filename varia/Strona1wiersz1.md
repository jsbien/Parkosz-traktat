 read ih̄c xp̄c

Unless the author knew Greek, it’s unlikely to be ιη̄ϲ χρ̄ϲ particularly given the shape of the h and the x

The "macron" above is an abbreviation mark in both cases.

It was totally usual in the Middle Ages to write the names Jesus and
Christ in Greek letters in a Latin environment (no matter whether the
scribes "knew" Greek or not). Cf., e.g.,
http://www.marburger-repertorien.de/abbildungen/pr/Paris_NAL_229_10r.jpg
where you have two times Christ written Xpict / xpict. on page 139r of
the ms. in
http://digital.bib-bvb.de/webclient/DeliveryManager?custom_att_2=simple_viewer&pid=5402038&childpid=5402320
you will find first Crist, then Xrist in the middle of the right column.
I would decide after the actual shape of the letters whether to encode
this as Latin (with x etc.) or as Greek (with χ etc.). The fact that
Christ (/ Jesus) is meant would rather be a question of XML annotation.

Best,
J.

Looks like Ιη͡ϲ χρ͡ϲ to me (i.e. Greek letters with maybe a lunate sigma) :-). I think in both cases I'd present the alternatives using <app>. Papyri.info does this with <app type="alternative">. See http://papyri.info/ddbdp/o.did;;84 line 2 (and the app.crit.) for an example.
